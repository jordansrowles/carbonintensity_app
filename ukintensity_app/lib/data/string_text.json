    "text": "The carbon intensity of electricity is the number of grams of carbon dioxide (CO2) it takes to make one unit of electricity at one kilowatt per hour (kW/hour).\n\nElectricity that’s generated using fossil fuels is more carbon intensive, as the process by which it’s generated creates CO2 emissions.\n\nRenewable energy sources, such as wind, hydro or solar power, produce next to no CO2 emissions, so their carbon intensity value is much lower and often zero.\n\nUsing electricity with a low carbon intensity value will reduce carbon emissions overall –especially if we use it during times when the largest amounts of clean electricity are being generated."
